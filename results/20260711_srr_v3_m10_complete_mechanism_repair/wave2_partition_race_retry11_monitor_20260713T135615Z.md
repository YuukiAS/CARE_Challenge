# M10 Wave 2 Retry11 D3 Step32720 Monitor

State: `NEEDS_MONITOR`

This is a monitor packet, not completion evidence and not a request for independent review.

## D3 Runtime Progress

D3 retry11 has written scheduled validation checkpoints through step `32720`, including:

```text
checkpoint_validation_step_27000.pt
checkpoint_validation_step_28630.pt
checkpoint_validation_step_30675.pt
checkpoint_validation_step_32720.pt
checkpoint_best.pt
```

D3 variant directory size at this checkpoint is approximately `7.4G`.

At this checkpoint D3 has not yet produced final `training_log.csv`, `validation_events.csv`, or `summary.json`.

## Decision

Current state remains `NEEDS_MONITOR`, not complete and not reviewable. D3 is still running after crossing the step floor and downstream stages remain correctly blocked by `afterok`. Wave 3, validation packaging/upload, hosted metric claims, route promotion, route-negative conclusion, review, push, and M11 remain blocked until Wave 2 terminal accounting and post-job aggregation succeed.
