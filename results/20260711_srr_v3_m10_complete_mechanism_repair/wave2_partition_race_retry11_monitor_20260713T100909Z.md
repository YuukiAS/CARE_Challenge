## D2 Runtime Progress

D2 retry11 has written scheduled validation checkpoints through step `18326`:

```

D2 variant directory size at this checkpoint is approximately `5.5G`.

At this checkpoint D2 has not yet produced final `training_log.csv`, `validation_events.csv`, or `summary.json`.

## Decision

Current state remains `NEEDS_MONITOR`, not complete and not reviewable. D2 is running with valid checkpoint progress and downstream stages remain correctly blocked by `afterok`. Wave 3, validation packaging/upload, hosted metric claims, route promotion, route-negative conclusion, review, push, and M11 remain blocked until Wave 2 terminal accounting and post-job aggregation succeed.
