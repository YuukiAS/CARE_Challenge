| D2 hierarchical PSIP | `58775066` | `PENDING (Dependency)` | waits on D1 `afterok` |

## Runtime Progress

D1 retry11 has written scheduled validation checkpoints through step 8330:

```text
checkpoint_validation_step_1666.pt
checkpoint_validation_step_3332.pt
checkpoint_validation_step_4998.pt
checkpoint_validation_step_5000.pt
checkpoint_validation_step_6664.pt
checkpoint_validation_step_8330.pt
checkpoint_best.pt
```

Retry11 has now exceeded retry5, retry6, retry7, and retry8 D1 OOM elapsed windows while remaining near `14G` RSS.

## Decision

Current state remains `NEEDS_MONITOR`, not complete and not reviewable. Wave 3, validation packaging/upload, hosted metric claims, route promotion, route-negative conclusion, review, push, and M11 remain blocked until Wave 2 terminal accounting and post-job aggregation succeed.
