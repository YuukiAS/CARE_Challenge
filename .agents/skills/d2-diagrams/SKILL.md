# D2 Diagrams

Use D2 for clean source-controlled diagrams. Keep the `.d2` file as the authoritative artifact.

## Workflow

1. Determine diagram type: architecture, infrastructure, sequence-like flow, ERD, state machine, or method pipeline.
2. Inspect source files or paper notes before diagramming. Do not infer architecture from names alone.
3. Draft `.d2` with stable node names and short labels.
4. Use clusters for subsystems, stages, datasets, or infrastructure boundaries.
5. Render to SVG/PNG only after the source is syntactically valid.
6. Report the `.d2` source path and rendered path.

## Style

- Prefer readable hierarchy over decorative complexity.
- Use color sparingly to encode ownership, stage, or risk.
- Keep long explanations in captions or Markdown, not node labels.
- For paper method figures, choose semantic stages and data transformations over implementation minutiae.

## Boundaries

- If D2 is not installed, create valid `.d2` source and state rendering was not run.
- Do not use D2 when the user explicitly needs editable draw.io output.
- Do not replace Mermaid in README contexts unless D2 gives a clear advantage.
