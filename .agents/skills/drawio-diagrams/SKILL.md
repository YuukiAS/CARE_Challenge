# draw.io Diagrams

Use this when editability matters. The canonical source should be `.drawio`, not only a rendered PNG.

## Workflow

1. Clarify diagram type, audience, paper/report context, and required output formats.
2. Create or edit `.drawio` XML as the source artifact.
3. Keep labels short and domain-specific.
4. Use stable layout: left-to-right for pipelines, top-to-bottom for stages, grouped regions for modules.
5. If exporting is requested, prefer SVG or PDF with embedded draw.io XML when supported so the figure remains editable.
6. Validate by reopening or inspecting XML structure when possible.

## Output Policy

- For manuscripts: deliver `.drawio` plus SVG/PDF export.
- For README/docs: deliver `.drawio` plus SVG or PNG.
- For early brainstorming: consider `excalidraw-diagrams` instead.
- For DSL-native architecture diagrams: consider `d2-diagrams`, `plantuml-diagrams`, or `markdown-mermaid-writing`.

## Boundaries

- Do not make only a screenshot when the user asked for editable diagrams.
- Do not rely on draw.io desktop CLI unless it is installed or the user accepts that dependency.
- Do not embed hidden assumptions in diagram labels; use notes or captions for uncertainty.
