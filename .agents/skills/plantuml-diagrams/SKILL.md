# PlantUML Diagrams

Use PlantUML when a formal UML or C4-style representation is useful.

## Workflow

1. Select the diagram family before writing source.
2. Gather entities, relationships, lifecycle states, actors, or deployment nodes from real artifacts.
3. Write `.puml` as the source of truth.
4. Render locally if PlantUML is available; otherwise use Kroki only if network access is acceptable.
5. Keep generated images next to the `.puml` file and report both paths.

## Diagram Selection

- Sequence: API calls, protocol flow, review/approval workflows.
- Activity: pipelines, decision logic, manuscript or experiment process.
- Class/component: codebase architecture and interfaces.
- Deployment: infrastructure, runtime topology, services.
- C4: context/container/component documentation.

## Boundaries

- Do not force PlantUML for informal ideation; use Mermaid or Excalidraw instead.
- Do not send private architecture to remote Kroki without permission.
- Do not invent classes or services that are not present in source artifacts.
